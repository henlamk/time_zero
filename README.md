# time_zero

I had the idea for this app while my sleep schedule shifted due to home office and flexible working hours. 
Depending on whenever I get up, I want to have a good feeling because no matter which time you get up, it is a new day ahead with lots of potential. 
This model lets me get to work and think "Oh, it's just the second hour of my day!" instead of "Sh*t, it's already 11 and I have clocked in just an hour ago."

A necessity for this to work effectively is to have a lose appointment schedule and a commitment of truly shifting your whole day.
